To remove background of video, in order to play on keynote, I try many methods,  from ffmpeg, website online tools. to iMovie.

1.Video tutorial for transparent website video for a [golf ball](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C67S5x7QWzc) on Mac. Output is mov. Tool: Adobe after effects(not free), Shutter Encoder. The very important step is done by Adobe after effects.
2.Use ffmpeg to replace [green background](https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&rls=en&q=Making+Transparent+Video+with+FFMPEG+by+Chroma+Keying+%7C+Tutorial&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8#fpstate=ive&vld=cid:444a68c3,vid:0tA4fauFykw) with transparent background.
3.Use [iMovie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZxPHQDRiF4) to combine video and png, replace green background with selected png.
